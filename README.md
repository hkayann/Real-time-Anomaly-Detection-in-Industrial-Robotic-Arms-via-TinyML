## Project Overview

This project aims to leverage the power of TinyML for real-time anomaly detection in industrial robotic arms, enhancing efficiency and safety in manufacturing environments. Utilizing the Nicla Sense ME, we develop and deploy models capable of identifying deviations from normal operations directly on the device, ensuring immediate response and minimal downtime.
